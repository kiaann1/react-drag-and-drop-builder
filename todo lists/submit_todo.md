# Form Submission Security & Functionality TODO List

## 1. Input Validation
- [ ] Validate all user inputs on the client-side for immediate feedback.
- [ ] Re-validate all fields server-side to prevent tampering or bypasses.

## 2. XSS & Injection Prevention
- [ ] Sanitize all user-submitted data before storing or rendering anywhere.
- [ ] Escape dynamic content on output (in confirmation emails, dashboards, etc.).

## 3. CSRF Protection
- [ ] Require CSRF tokens on all form submission endpoints that mutate data.
- [ ] Use same-site cookies for authentication/session tokens.

## 4. Rate Limiting & Spam Prevention
- [ ] Implement rate limiting on form submission endpoints.
- [ ] Integrate CAPTCHA or similar anti-bot protection for public forms.
- [ ] Optionally, add honeypot fields to catch bots.

## 5. Data Storage & Privacy
- [ ] Encrypt sensitive form submission data at rest (database, backups).
- [ ] Always transmit form data over HTTPS.
- [ ] Enforce access controls so only authorized users can view submissions.
- [ ] Clearly inform users how their data will be used (privacy policy, consent).

## 6. Confirmation & Feedback
- [ ] Display a clear success message after successful submission.
- [ ] Handle and display errors gracefully (network errors, validation issues).
- [ ] Optionally, send confirmation emails to respondents.

## 7. Notification & Logging
- [ ] Notify form owner of new submissions (email, dashboard notification, etc.).
- [ ] Log submissions and errors for auditing/troubleshooting.

## 8. API Security (if exposing endpoints)
- [ ] Authenticate/authorize API requests for form submissions (if private forms).
- [ ] Sanitize and validate all incoming API data.

## 9. Export/Download Submissions
- [ ] Allow only authorized users to export/download form submissions.
- [x] Sanitize export data to prevent injection/XSS in CSV, Excel, etc.

## 10. Accessibility & Usability
- [ ] Ensure submit button is accessible (keyboard, screen readers).
- [ ] Provide clear labels and error messages for each field.
- [ ] Prevent double submissions (disable submit button on submit or show loading).
